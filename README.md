# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

## Overview

This project is an interactive visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm, developed using Python and Pygame. It features a user-friendly grid interface that allows users to place obstacles and initiate pathfinding with a single keystroke. The primary goal is to enhance user engagement and provide a deeper understanding of the A* algorithm by showcasing its decision-making process and highlighting the most optimal path discovered.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid Interface**: Easily place and remove obstacles on a grid.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Observe the A* algorithm in action.
- **Educational Insights**: Gain valuable insights into the algorithm's decision-making process.

## Usage

1. **Launch the application**: Run `python main.py` to start the visualization.
2. **Interact with the grid**:
   - **Left Click**: Place the start and end point.
   - **Spacebar**: Start the pathfinding algorithm.

## How It Works

The A* pathfinding algorithm combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First-Search, using a heuristic to guide its search. This visualization illustrates its steps, from initialization and node exploration to pathfinding and optimal path discovery.
